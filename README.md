### 👋 Hi there, I'm Stephanie!

#### 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate **Software Engineer** with a knack for creating robust and scalable web applications. My toolkit includes **JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, TypeScript, GraphQL, SQL, NoSQL, Cypress, and Jest**. I'm an avid **open source contributor** and love to immerse myself in the full stack of development.

#### 🐾 Current Project: NutriPup
My current venture is **[NutriPup](https://github.com/stephanie-115/nutripup)**, an innovative app dedicated to canine nutrition. Born from my personal journey with my English Bulldog, Stanley, it aims to help dog owners craft nutritious meals tailored to their furry friends. It's a project where my love for dogs and coding intersects!

#### 💻 Open to Collaboration
I'm always eager to collaborate with fellow developers and contribute to meaningful projects. If you're looking for someone who can add value with extensive full-stack skills and a creative approach, let's connect!

#### 🌱 Learning and Growing
Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by diving into **AWS**. I believe in continuous learning and am excited about incorporating cloud technologies into my work.

#### 📖 Beyond Code
When I'm not coding, you'll find me whipping up gourmet meals for Stanley (I'm a self-proclaimed crockpot canine chef!), lost in a good book, or reminiscing about my days as a teacher.
