### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Stephanie!

#### ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a passionate **Software Engineer** with a knack for creating robust and scalable web applications. My toolkit includes **JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, TypeScript, GraphQL, SQL, NoSQL, Cypress, and Jest**. I'm an avid **open source contributor** and love to immerse myself in the full stack of development.

#### ðŸŒ· Current Project: GreenPets
My current venture is **[GreenPets](https://github.com/Los-Terremotos/GreenPets)**, an innovative app dedicated to prospective plant parents. 

#### ðŸ’» Open to Collaboration
I'm always eager to collaborate with fellow developers and contribute to meaningful projects. If you're looking for someone who can add value with extensive full-stack skills and a creative approach, let's connect!

#### ðŸŒ± Learning and Growing
Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by diving into **AWS**. I believe in continuous learning and am excited about incorporating cloud technologies into my work.

#### ðŸ“– Beyond Code
When I'm not coding, you'll find me whipping up gourmet meals for Stanley (I'm a self-proclaimed crockpot canine chef!), lost in a good book, or reminiscing about my days as a teacher.
